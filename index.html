<li><a href="https://landens.itch.io/legend-of-zelda-unity">Legend of Zelda (Unity Rebuild)</a></li>
</ul>
<p> Information:
    This is a remake of the legend of zelda (NES) which features the first dungeon and a custom level.
    Access the custom level by pressing the number 4 on your keyboard.

    Contribution:
    The enemies I worked on were: Stalfos, Keese, Blade Traps, Cannon Traps, Wallmasters, and Aquamentus.
    I designed the health and damage system, the knockback system and room transitions.
    I created the UI and pickup items for health, rupees, and bombs.
    Along with designing many of the rooms in the main dungeon, I also added a few of the custom level rooms.
    Lastly, I drew the cannon sprites and link's flying sprites.

    Technology:
    For this project, I used github and Unity with code written in C#.
    I also used generative AI for help with coding.
